                  BRIDGTON, MAINE – June 30, 2021 – The Wireless Outdoor Cinema
                  Company
                </strong>{" "}
                today announced the unveiling of the new Outdoor Cinema
                Projector and Equipment Stand for homeowners and businesses who
                have or want an outdoor movie theater setup. The Outdoor
                Projector Stand is the first one introduced into the
                marketplace.
              </p>
              <p className="xl:text-23 text-base press-text font-extralight pb-5">
                The projector and equipment stand allows you to organize your
                Projector, Media Player, DVD player, Tuner, Transmitter, Gaming
                Console, and other equipment on the various shelves located on
                the stand. The projector stand is made from lightweight 5/4”
                thick cedar wood and acts as an entertainment center that you
                would have inside your home. The cinema components stay
                organized on the projector stand, and you never have to break it
                down or remove any of the equipment after watching a movie
                outside.

                  "When I searched the internet last year to find a projector
                  stand to go with my wireless outdoor cinemas, there were no
                  options other than flimsy tripod projector stands," said Todd
                  Morton, owner of the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company. "The
                  tripod projector stands available online only have enough
                  space to hold the projector and no other cinema equipment.
                  After a year of designing, building, and testing various
                  outdoor projector stands in my woodshop, I came up with my
                  latest design that I now include with all my outdoor cinemas."
