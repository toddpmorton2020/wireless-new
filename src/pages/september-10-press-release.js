                The 107.5 Frank FM Pro Football Challenge contest works by
                determining which Pro Football teams will win each week and by
                how many points. Participants who are the closest to guessing
                what Pro Football teams win each week and by the final score
                will get points that will be tallied up week-over-week until the
                season ends. Then, the person who receives the most points wins
                the giveaway contest.
